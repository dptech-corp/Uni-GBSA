title: COVID-19 related proteins
---


Given its relevance, we have tested gmx_MMPBSA with multiple COVID-19 related systems. The ultimate goal is to provide 
a useful tool for those researchers working on COVID-19 projects. The capability of gmx_MMPBSA to handle systems 
that combine a number of characteristics (i.e. metalloprotein-ligand, Protein-protein, Membrane proteins, glycosylated 
proteins etc.) constitutes a tremendous help for those researchers that use MD simulations and binding free energy 
calculations in their projects. We plan to incorporate more systems as they arise in the literature and databases.

All these systems haven been previously prepared in CHARMM-GUI, and they are available at the [CHARMM-GUI Archive - COVID-19 Proteins Library](https://charmm-gui.org/?doc=archive&lib=covid19).
