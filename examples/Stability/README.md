# Stability calculations

!!! info
    This example can be found in the [docs/examples/Stability/][6] directory in the repository folder. If you didn't 
    use gmx_MMPBSA_test before, use [downgit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home) to download the specific folder from 
    gmx_MMPBSA Github repository

## Requirements

In this case, `gmx_MMPBSA` requires:


| Input File required            | Required |           Type             | Description |
|:-------------------------------|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input parameters file          | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |           `in`          | Input file containing all the specifications regarding the type of calculation that is going to be performed |
| The MD Structure+mass(db) file | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |    `tpr` `pdb` `gro`    | Structure file containing the system coordinates |
| An index file                  | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |          `ndx`    | File containing the receptor and ligand in separated groups |
| Receptor and ligand group      | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |        `integers`       | Group numbers in the index files |
| A trajectory file              | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } | `xtc` `pdb` `gro` `trr` | Final GROMACS MD trajectory, fitted and with no pbc. |
| A topology file (not included) | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_opt .scale_icon_medium }    |           `top`         | GROMACS topology file (The `* .itp` files defined in the topology must be in the same folder |
| A Reference Structure file     | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_optrec .scale_icon_medium } |           `pdb`         | Complex reference structure file (without hydrogens) with the desired assignment of chain ID and residue numbers |
              
:octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req } -> Must be defined -- :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_optrec } -> 
Optional, but recommended -- :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_opt } -> Optional

_See a detailed list of all the flags in gmx_MMPBSA command line [here][1]_

## Command-line
That being said, once you are in the folder containing all files, the command-line will be as follows:

=== "gmx_MMPBSA_test"

        gmx_MMPBSA_test -t stability

=== "Serial"

        gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -s -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 19 20 -ct com_traj.xtc

=== "With MPI"

        mpirun -np 2 gmx_MMPBSA MPI -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 19 20 -ct com_traj.xtc

where the `mmpbsa.in` input file, is a text file containing the following lines:

```  linenums="1"
Sample input file for GB calculation
This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Althought,
we tried to used the input files as recommended in the Amber manual,
some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations
in a reasonable amount of time. Feel free to change the parameters 
according to what is better for your system.

&general
startframe=5, endframe=21, verbose=2, interval=1,
protein_forcefield="oldff/leaprc.ff99SB",
/

&gb
igb=2, saltcon=0.150,
/
```

_See a detailed list of all the options in `gmx_MMPBSA` input file [here][2] as well as several [examples][3]_

  
## Considerations
In this case, a single trajectory (ST) approximation is followed, which means the receptor and ligand (in this case, the 
ligand is also another protein) amber format topologies and trajectories will be obtained from that of the complex. To 
do so, a MD Structure+mass(db) file (`com.tpr`), an index file (`index.ndx`), a trajectory file (`com_traj.xtc`), and 
both the receptor and ligand group numbers in the index file (`19 20`) are needed. The `mmpbsa.in` input file will 
contain all the parameters needed for the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation. In this case, 16 frames `(endframe-startframe)/interval = (21-5)/1 = 16`
are going to be used when performing the the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation with the igb2 (GB-OBC1) model and a salt 
concentration = 0.15M.

"Stability" calculation will be performed, and you will get statistics based on only a single system (complex). Any 
additional receptor or ligand information given will be ignored.
!!! note
    Once the calculation is done, you can analyze the results in `gmx_MMPBSA_ana` (if you didn't define `-nogui`).
